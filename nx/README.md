# Template Series

By Francis Villarba

## Docker Templates - Nx

DockerFiles that I have specifically used for projects running within NX.

This has been seperated into a few sections:

* Local (Localhost Running)
* Dev (Development Server Running)
* Prod (Production Server Running)

You will also find the files within have the following naming convention
nx-[stack/language].Dockerfile

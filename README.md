# Template Series

By Francis Villarba

## Base Repo

The purpose of the base repo template is to have a generalised / template to
create projects off.

This is a personal template that I use for my projects.

For anyone that looks into it, I hope you find it useful ðŸ˜„

## Important Notes

When using this REPO, you will still need to do some customisations, these are as follows:

1. Update the README.md documentation
2. Add additional project specific .gitignore'ed files
3. Choose the correct license type & update any copyrights to be in-date & valid
4. Add project specific security policy & changes to as required

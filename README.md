# Template Series

## Docker Templates

The purpose of the repo is to store all the docker files that I have created / customised
in one place, so I can easily re-use, update them and document them for later use.

This is a personal template that I use for my projects.

For anyone that looks into it, I hope you find it useful ðŸ˜„
